# Overview

This web app keeps track of what the user has in their pantry. It is organized by meals as well as having a section for snacks and desert. The first page allows the user to input an item and send it to the appropiate table. The tables each have their own page where they display what food the user has put in them. 

I wanted to plan my meals out better. After I go grocery shopping, I put in my meals and during the week I empty out my pantry. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running (starting the server and navigating through the web pages) and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Web Pages

The index page is the home page. It allows for the user to put in a food and sort it into one of the meal categories.
Breakfast.html displays the breakfast foods.
Lunch displays the lunch food.
Dinner, snack, and desert all display their respective foods. On each page food can be deleted. 

# Development Environment

I used VS Code to create this software.  I also used replit to edit when I did not have access to my personal laptop.

I used Python and html as well as css to create this program.

# Future Work

* Add a page to view all the items entered.
* Make the pages prettier.
* I would also add in more categories for adding items.
